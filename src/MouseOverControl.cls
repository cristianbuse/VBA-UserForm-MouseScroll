'' Description:
''    - This object holds a single reference to a MSForms.UserForm or a
''      MSForms.Control that is capable of having a MouseMove event
''    - The reference is set using the InitFromControl method and can be any of
''      the 13 types listed below
''    - When the MouseMove event is triggered, the hovered control is passed to
''      the SetHoveredControl method in the MouseScroll module
''    - This class is also used as an asyncronous callback via the Terminate
'       event. In this case events are not used. This choice removed the need
''      to use a new class just for the Terminate event
'' Notes:
''    This class implements Scroll events for the container types (frame, form
''       and multiPage) in order to supress any scrolls that are related to the
''       controls getting the focus.
'' Requires:
''    - MouseScroll: module enabling Mouse Message processing
